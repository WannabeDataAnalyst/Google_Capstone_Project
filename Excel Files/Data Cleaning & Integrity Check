Data Integrity

The metadata on Kaggle shows that Mobius is the owner of the data. 
Therefore, it should be original data attained by Mobius. 
I will need to clean the data by sorting and filtering, looking for anomalies to ensure its reliability. 
I will read the headers and some values to check if it is comprehensive.
Although the data is from December of 2020, it appears to still be current as I have not found any significant changes to similar smart devices. 

Data Cleaning

1. I made a copy of the following documents before making any changes to the originals. 

2. Changes to the following files:
weightLogInfo_merged.csv, 
heartrate_seconds_merged.csv, 
hourlyCalories_merged.csv,

--Separate the date from the date and time in each cell. 
I inserted two columns next to the Date column (column B) and used the INT function to separate the date in column C. 
I then used formula =B2-C2 to get the time in column D. 
I formatted the columns to date and time, respectively. 
I copied and then pasted column C as values. I did the same to column D.  
I then deleted column B.
When I imported this data into SQL, I checked to see that SQL recognized it as Time and not as a String. 

3. Changes to sleepDay_merged.csv 
--Format the date as it contained date and time in the same cell.
This file contained relatively few rows and all the times in each row upon inspection were midnight. 
I selected the date column (column B) and formatted it to date to remove the time. 

--Change header for data mapping purposes
I changed the date column header from “SleepDay” to “Date”

4. I have spot checked the data for anomalies and "null" strings but didn’t find any.
