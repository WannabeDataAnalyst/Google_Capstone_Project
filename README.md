# Executive Summary
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze how people use their Fitbit smart devices to find opportunities for growth and provide recommendations to guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.  
After cleaning, and analyzing the data, I found that most smart watch users are active for only a few hours a day. This may indicate that most consumers of smart watches are not blue-collar workers. 
Additionally, half of the participants (four out of eight) that provided BMI data were overweight and half (twelve out of twenty four) slept less than the recommended seven hours (How much sleep do I need?, 2019).  
However, most users walked more than the recommended 5000 steps a day which is considered necessary as shown by a study done by the University of Texas (Lindsay Bottoms, The Conversation, 2021). 
Bellabeat can focus their marketing strategy on showing how their Time watch caters to the individual needs of customers by providing them with suggestions to help them maintain a healthy body since most people buy smart watches without displays to track health related metrics.

# Introduction

Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat's(a smart device company)  would like more insight into how consumers use their smart devices to guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy. She believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 

The Time watch by Bellabeat’s is the product I chose to focus on. People who purchase this watch receive 3 months of exercising and meditating with the Bellabeat Wellness Coach. This usually costs $9.99 a month. The Time watch works with an APP. It helps people monitor their health to achieve total body wellness. 
It gives people insight into their daily lifestyle by providing metrics to help inform their dietary and activity decisions. 
The Time watch is focused on women and provides menstrual cycle support though tracking metrics and providing users with information via the APP about each stage of their menstruation cycle. 
Together, the Time watch and the APP have features such as monitoring stress levels and offers yoga routines and meditation to help manage stress levels. 
In addition to this, personalized exercise routines and meal plans are also provided, and the Time watch helps monitor calories burned each and compare that to the amount of food consumed to manage weight and BMI levels. 


Data Used for Analysis

Urška Sršen is a co-founder and and has directed me to a dataset called FitBit Fitness Tracker Data that was made available through Mobius and which I downloaded from the Kaggle website.

Some limitations and assumptions of the data provided:

1.	The dataset included just 33 participants for activity. 24 users provided information about sleep, 8 users provided information about their BMI levels and just 7 had heart rate data. 
2.	It is unknown whether participants are male or female and Bellabeat’s focuses on female customers. 
3.	The time zone was not provided. I assumed that it was given according to each user’s location eg. 12:00 is midday at their location. 
4.	The criteria that differentiate intensity is unknown. 
5.	Participants ages were not provided and so their recommended caloric needs could not be calculated. 
6.	Distance metrics are unknown. I assumed kilometers. 

The metadata shows that the data was created on the 16th of December 2020, however, from my research it appears that people buy them mostly to monitor their activity and the most significant use that I came across would be for smart watches to help identify when people need medical care. While smart watches can monitor metrics like heart rates and indicate when a user’s heart rate may be too low, these features are still in its infancy stage as it would also need to check other health metrics such as blood pressure to be more useful. Additionally, use for health care decisions will require evaluation of these devices for that purpose by the relevant authorities in each country. ()


Analysis















Conclusion

Assuming a client logs their daily diet manually the Time watch can be used in conjunction with the Bellabeat App to track their daily calorie needs and provide suggestions of foods with the nutrition that the client lacks for the day. 

The Time watch offers people the ability to stay in optimal health by not only tracking the amount of calories burned in their daily activities but also tracks heart rates which offer insights into when people should consult a doctor eg. if they have a high or low resting heart rate.

Additionally, if people input their weight and height into the Bellabeat App, their BMI can be calculated and the Time watch can help them (by tracking data such as calories burned and heart rates) move towards or stay in the recommended BMI ranges of a healthy adult. 

In conclusion, Bellabeats can focus their marketing strategy on showing people how their Time watch helps individuals and does not take a one size fits all approach when catering providing clients with information.
